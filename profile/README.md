## Intelligent Machine Learning
Intelligent Machine Learning (IML) targets to set up a full-stack, high-performant, and intelligent infrastructure of deep learning for both offline and online, including data processing, model training, model evaluation, and model inferencing, and makes DL real engineering-free and democratic for AI-driven biz.
